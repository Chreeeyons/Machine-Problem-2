For this machine problem, you are given 2 sorted lists of strings.

Your goal is to merge the two sorted lists into one sorted list.

Implement the following function:

int merge(string A[], string B[], string C[], int n, int m);
Assume A has n elements, B has m elements, and that C can accommodate n + m elements.

Your goal is to merge the sorted elements of A and B into C and make sure that they stay sorted.

The function merge should also return the number of comparisons made when merging A and B into C.

In case of duplicates, take the string from A first.

Samples
Input:

**4 cayennepepper ginger tarragon turmeric
4 celeryseed marjoram saffron whitepepper**
Output:

**7
cayennepepper celeryseed ginger marjoram saffron tarragon turmeric
Apart from printing the contents of C, the number of string comparisons is printed. In the sample above, 7 string comparisons were made. The comparisons were for the following:**

**"cayennepepper" with "celeryseed"
"ginger" with "celeryseed"
"ginger" with "marjoram"
"marjoram" with "tarragon"
"saffron" with "tarragon"
"tarragon" with "whitepepper"
"turmeric" with "whitepepper"**
Input:

**3 coriander dill nutmeg
3 thyme vanillabean wormwood**
Output:

**3
coriander dill nutmeg thyme vanillabean wormwood
Here, only 3 string comparisons were made:

"coriander" with "thyme"
"dill" with "thyme"
"nutmeg" with "thyme"
No more string comparisons were made, since A has run out of strings.**

**Note
Do not create a main function.

Implement merge only.
